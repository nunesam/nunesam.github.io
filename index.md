## Abner M. Nunes, PhD

I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in the synthesis, characterization, and application of engineered nanoparticles, particularly gold nanoparticles, as therapeutic agents. I hold a Master's in Pharmacy and a PhD in Chemistry, which have provided me with a solid foundation in both nanotechnology and cellular biology.
My research focuses on understanding how the unique properties of nanoparticles—such as size, shape, and surface coating—affect their interactions with biological systems. I am particularly interested in their intracellular trafficking, mitochondrial targeting, and clearance mechanisms, while ensuring that these nanoparticles are both effective and safe. I also investigate their toxicity profiles to design safe, innovative nanomaterials for biomedical applications.
Driven by a passion for advancing nanomedicine, I aim to contribute to the development of cutting-edge nanomaterials that have the potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches, from drug delivery to clinical interventions, while ensuring their responsible and safe use in medical settings.

## Research 
### Engineering Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications and Mechanism Exploration
Gold nanoparticles have been extensively researched for a variety of biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, imaging, diagnostics, and therapy, because of their tunable properties and biocompatibility.

Modifying nanoparticles' surfaces with biomolecules such as DNA, peptides, miRNA, or therapeutic agents can directly influence their cellular interactions, biodistribution, and overall biomedical fate. My research interest lies in exploring these surface modifications to contribute to the development of cutting-edge nanomaterials with the potential to transform therapeutic strategies—from precision drug delivery to clinical interventions—while ensuring their safe and responsible use in medical settings.
