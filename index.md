## Abner M. Nunes, PhD

I am a postdoctoral researcher at Auburn University with expertise in the synthesis, characterization, and application of engineered nanoparticles, particularly gold nanoparticles, as therapeutic agents. With a Master's in Pharmacy and a PhD in Chemistry, I’m fascinated by the potential of nanomedicine to transform healthcare. My research interest focuses on understanding how the unique properties of nanoparticles—such as size, shape, and surface coating—affect their interactions with biological systems. I am particularly interested in their intracellular trafficking, mitochondrial targeting, and clearance mechanisms, while ensuring that these nanoparticles are both effective and safe.
Driven by a passion for advancing nanomedicine, I aim to contribute to the development of cutting-edge nanomaterials that have the potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches.

## Research Interest
### Engineering Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications
Gold nanoparticles have been widely explored for diverse biomedical applications, including drug delivery, imaging, diagnostics, and therapy, due to their unique tunable properties and relative biocompatibility. They hold significant promise in clinical research, with some  gold-based nanoformulations advancing in clinical trials, targeting conditions such as advanced and metastatic solid tumors, glioblastoma, Parkinson's disease, multiple and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, and arthritis.

<i>Surface modifications of nanoparticles play a key role in determining their downstream applications</i>

A key aspect driving their biomedical potential lies in surface modification. Functionalizing nanoparticles with biomolecules such as [protein](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tox.2018.12.002), [polysaccharide](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2021.06.172), DNA, miRNA, or therapeutic agents can directly influence their cellular interactions, biodistribution, and overall biomedical fate. Investigating these surface modifications holds great promise for engineering nanomaterials that not only enhance therapeutic efficacy but also offer innovative solutions for diseases that currently lack effective treatments.

### Impact of Nanoparticle Physicochemical Properties on Interactions with Cells and Organelles

The physicochemical properties of nanoparticles—such as size, shape, and surface chemistry—play a critical role in how they interact with cells and organelles. For example, gold nanorods have shown selective interaction in certain cancer cells, suggesting their potential for targeted therapies. In some of my previous [works](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11051-022-05410-w), I investigated the role of the nanoparticles shape and found that gold nanospheres and nanorods differentially affect isolated mitochondria, highlighting distinct mechanisms of interaction. Understanding these differences is key to designing nanoparticles with optimized therapeutic performance and minimal off-target effects.

### Nanoparticle Clearance and Intercellular Communication

While interacting with cells, the localization of nanoparticles is crucial for determining their fate and the mechanisms through which they impact cellular functions. The precise subcellular distribution of these nanoparticles can influence their interactions with organelles, cellular signaling pathways, and overall biological activity.

Gold nanoparticles specially undergo a cycle of biodegradation and recrystallization within lysosomes, ultimately forming biopersistent nanostructures. However, much remains unknown about this process, particularly how these biopersistent structures may affect cellular homeostasis and contribute to long-term biological responses. Additionally, the mechanisms of exocytosis of these nanoparticles are not well understood. This process may be crucial not only for cellular clearance but also for mediating intercellular communication. [Previously](https://doi.org/10.1039/D2NA00694D), we showed that the intracellular trafficking routes of gold nanoparticles often significantly overlap with those involved in the biogenesis of small extracellular vesicles (exosomes). This intersection suggests that AuNPs could influence exosome formation and function, which may have downstream effects on intracellular signaling.

## Community Involvement

I’m passionate about outreach and sharing science with the community. As a volunteer at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, I have the opportunity to connect with local students, teaching them about biodiversity and science through interactive experiences with our animal ambassadors, like Bagel the turtle and Brown the ball python (pictured).

I’ve also had the chance to present at STEM EmpowHER, hosted by Auburn University Outreach, where I shared discussions on nanoscience and its real-world applications with female students from the community. Another highlight of my year is participating in the Alabama Science and Engineering Fair, where I have served as a judge since 2023. It’s always rewarding to support young students, see their creativity, and help inspire their interest in science. These experiences are a constant reminder of why I love science and education.
