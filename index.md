## Abner M. Nunes, PhD

I am a postdoctoral researcher specializing in the synthesis, characterization, and application of engineered nanoparticles, particularly gold nanoparticles, as therapeutic agents. I hold a Master's in Pharmacy and a PhD in Chemistry, which have provided me with a solid foundation in both nanotechnology and cellular biology.
My research focuses on understanding how the unique properties of nanoparticles—such as size, shape, and surface coating—affect their interactions with biological systems. I am particularly interested in their intracellular trafficking, mitochondrial targeting, and clearance mechanisms, while ensuring that these nanoparticles are both effective and safe. I also investigate their toxicity profiles to design safe, innovative nanomaterials for biomedical applications.
Driven by a passion for advancing nanomedicine, I aim to contribute to the development of cutting-edge nanomaterials that have the potential to revolutionize therapeutic approaches, from drug delivery to clinical interventions, while ensuring their responsible and safe use in medical settings.

## Research Interest
### Engineering Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications and Mechanism Exploration
Gold nanoparticles have been extensively researched for a variety of biomedical applications, such as drug delivery, imaging, diagnostics, and therapy, because of their tunable properties and biocompatibility.

Modifying nanoparticles' surfaces with biomolecules such as DNA, peptides, miRNA, or therapeutic agents can directly influence their cellular interactions, biodistribution, and overall biomedical fate. My research interest lies in exploring these surface modifications to contribute to the development of cutting-edge nanomaterials with the potential to transform therapeutic strategies—from precision drug delivery to clinical interventions—while ensuring their safe and responsible use in medical settings.

### Nanoparticle Fate and Intercellular Communication

The localization of gold nanoparticles within cells is crucial for determining their fate and the mechanisms through which they impact cellular functions. The precise subcellular distribution of these nanoparticles can influence their interactions with organelles, cellular signaling pathways, and overall biological activity.

It has been shown that, over the long term, gold nanoparticles undergo a cycle of biodegradation and recrystallization within lysosomes, ultimately forming biopersistent nanostructures. However, much remains unknown about this process, particularly how these biopersistent structures may affect cellular homeostasis and contribute to long-term biological responses. Additionally, the mechanisms of exocytosis of these nanoparticles are not well understood, yet they may play a significant role in cell–cell communication. It is also possible that these nanoparticles, through exocytosis, could be involved in the release of extracellular vesicles like exosomes, which are known to mediate intercellular signaling. Exploring these processes is essential for enhancing our understanding of nanoparticle behavior within biological systems and for optimizing their design to ensure both their efficacy and safety in biomedical applications.

## Community Involvement

I’m passionate about outreach and sharing science with the community. As a volunteer at the Auburn University Museum of Natural History, I have the opportunity to connect with local students, teaching them about biodiversity and science through interactive experiences with our animal ambassadors, like Bagel the turtle and Brown the ball python (pictured).

I’ve also had the chance to present at STEM EmpowHER, hosted by Auburn University Outreach, where I shared discussions on nanoscience and its real-world applications with female students from the community. Another highlight of my year is participating in the Alabama Science and Engineering Fair, where I have served as a judge since 2023. It’s always rewarding to support young students, see their creativity, and help inspire their interest in science. These experiences are a constant reminder of why I love science and education.
